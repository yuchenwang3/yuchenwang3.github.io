I am a Computer Science graduate student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), expected to graduate in 2027. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Intelligence Science and Technology from Peking University in 2025.

My research interests include machine learning, LLM systems, and computer vision. I have hands-on experience with various projects, including dynamic prefill optimization for LLMs, CUDA kernel optimization for GPT-2 inference, reinforcement learning for legal reasoning, and interactive world models for video generation.



I am proficient in Python, C, C++, and LaTeX, with advanced skills in PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, and LLM systems like vLLM and Megatron-LM. I have received several academic awards, including the Zhi Class Scholarship from Peking University and the First Prize in the Provincial Chinese Mathematical Olympiad.

Feel free to explore my website to learn more about my projects and experiences, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or opportunities for collaboration.
